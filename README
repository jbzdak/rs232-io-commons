Short description
=================

This library was developed to ease communitation with various electronic equipement that is accessible via
RS-232--USB converters.

It's features:

1. Simple api for command -- response pattern (computer sends commands and device sends single response per command).
2. Api to create port from properties file (all port properties are described in that file).
3. Mechanism to plug in new port implementations. As of today
4. Implementation of port communication using termios on linux.

It's downsides:

1. Performance was not a design goal, having clear API and simple implementation was.
2. It is used with: no parity, 8 data bits, one stop bit, so this setting is tested, other settings are not so tested.
3. It is a yet new api for ports.


Status
======

RxTx implementation was tested througtfully, termios implementation will be tested in the coming months.

Termios bindings
================

As of today i couldn't get RxTx library to work on Linux x64 bit using USB converters. Since I didn't got an impression
that RXTX was actively maintained --- I decided to roll my own solution (and learn termios linux API). Java
communications api doesn't even have an implementanion for linux x64.

This solution uses JNA to access native linux libraries.

As of today it was tested using loopback usb converter (usb converter that has Rx and Tx cables solded), so it sends
everything back.

Creating port
=============
Example properties are located in io-commons-api/src/test/resources/example.properties.

Load these properties and then pass them to IOCommonsEntryPoint.createPort. For examples see termios/port/src/test

To use all implementations and plugin loadnig mechanism please use io-commons-providers module.

Command api
===========
Simple API for command driven equipement. Please see classes CommandDriver, SimpleCommandDriver and Command.


Building
========

I use maven build system, but (for now) I don't have a public repository for my code, so please download following dependencies (also from github)

* commons --- my common libraries
* linux-serial-io --- my termios bindings

install them and then install this library.
